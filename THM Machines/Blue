-->  Recon

Scan and learn what exploit this machine is vulnerable to. Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up. This room is not meant to be a boot2root CTF, rather, this is an educational series for complete beginners. Professionals will likely get very little out of this room beyond basic practice as the process here is meant to be beginner-focused.

-->  Find flags!

Flag1? This flag can be found at the system root. 
c:\flag1.txt
ANS   -->  flag{access_the_machine}

Flag2? This flag can be found at the location where passwords are stored within Windows.
*Errata: Windows really doesn't like the location of this flag and can occasionally delete it. It may be necessary in some cases to terminate/restart the machine and rerun the exploit to find this flag. This relatively rare, however, it can happen. 
c:\Windows\System32\config\flag2.txt
ANS  -->  flag{sam_database_elevated_access}

flag3? This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved. 
c:\Users\Jon\Documents\flag3.txt
ANS  -->flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}

** to solve this we need to find the flag1.txt(looked on internet) --> then search flag1.txt , flag2.txt and flag3.txt using search -f in meterpreter
