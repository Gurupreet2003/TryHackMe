----> System Configuration utility (MSConfig)
The System Configuration utility (MSConfig) is for advanced troubleshooting, and its main purpose is to help diagnose startup issues. 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/system-configuration-utility-troubleshoot-configuration-errors --> for more information on the System Configuration utility. 

Note: You need local administrator rights to open this utility. 

The utility has five tabs across the top. Below are the names for each tab. We will briefly cover each tab in this task. 
--> General
--> Boot
--> Services
--> Startup
--> Tools

In the General tab, we can select what devices and services for Windows to load upon boot. The options are: Normal, Diagnostic, or Selective.
In the Boot tab, we can define various boot options for the Operating System. 
The Services tab lists all services configured for the system regardless of their state (running or stopped). A service is a special type of application that runs in the background.  
As you can see, Microsoft advises using Task Manager (taskmgr) to manage (enable/disable) startup items. The System Configuration utility is NOT a startup management program. 

Note: If you open Task Manager for the attached VM, you will notice that Task Manager doesn't show a Startup tab. 

There is a list of various utilities (tools) in the Tools tab that we can run to configure the operating system further. There is a brief description of each tool to provide some insight into what the tool is for. 
To run a tool, we can use the command to launch the tool via the run prompt, command prompt, or by clicking the Launch button

task--> 
1.) What is the name of the service that lists Systems Internals as the manufacturer?
ans) "PSshutdown" --> msconfig hide all microsoft services manufacturer then look for system internals you will find one

2.) Whom is the Windows license registered to?
ans) "Windows user" --> go to tools tab in msconfig then look for ""about windows"" with discription - ""display windows version information""

3.) What is the command for Windows Troubleshooting?
ans) "C:\Windows\System32\control.exe /name Microsoft.Troubleshooting" --> same at tool under msconfig look for "Windows Troubleshooting"

4.) What command will open the Control Panel? (The answer is  the name of .exe, not the full path)
ans) "control.exe" --> under tool each files open first control.exe then changes to some other windows eg :- C:\Windows\System32\control.exe /name Microsoft.Troubleshooting

--> The UAC settings can be changed or even turned off entirely (not recommended).
You can move the slider to see how the setting will change the UAC settings and Microsoft's stance on the setting. (in UAC settings)

----> The Computer Management (compmgmt) utility has three primary sections: System Tools, Storage, and Services and Applications.

1.)  System Tools
Let's start with --> Task Scheduler. Per Microsoft, with Task Scheduler, we can create and manage common tasks that our computer will carry out automatically at the times we specify.
A task can run an application, a script, etc., and tasks can be configured to run at any point. A task can run at log in or at log off. Tasks can also be configured to run on a specific schedule, for example, every five mins.
To create a basic task, click on Create Basic Task under Actions (right pane).
""""""""""""""""""""""""
--> Event Viewer.
Event Viewer allows us to view events that have occurred on the computer. These records of events can be seen as an audit trail that can be used to understand the activity of the computer system. This information is often used to diagnose problems and investigate actions executed on the system. 
Event Viewer has three panes.
--> The pane on the left provides a hierarchical tree listing of the event log providers.
--> The pane in the middle will display a general overview and summary of the events specific to a selected provider.
--> The pane on the right is the actions pane.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-types

There are five types of events that can be logged.
Event type	                                                                                      Description
--> Error	                                      An event that indicates a significant problem such as loss of data or loss of functionality. For example, if a service fails to load during startup, an Error event is logged.
--> Warning	                                    An event that is not necessarily significant, but may indicate a possible future problem. For example, when disk space is low, a Warning event is logged. If an application can recover from an event without loss of functionality or data, it can generally classify the event as a Warning event.
--> Information	                                An event that describes the successful operation of an application, driver, or service. For example, when a network driver loads successfully, it may be appropriate to log an Information event. Note that it is generally inappropriate for a desktop application to log an event each time it starts.
--> Success Audit	                              An event that records an audited security access attempt that is successful. For example, a user's successful attempt to log on to the system is logged as a Success Audit event.
--> Failure Audit	                              An event that records an audited security access attempt that fails. For example, if a user tries to access a network drive and fails, the attempt is logged as a Failure Audit event.

The standard logs are visible under Windows Logs.
Log	                                                                                            Description
--> Application	                                                            Contains events logged by applications. For example, a database application might record a file error. The application developer decides which events to record.
--> Security	                                                              Contains events such as valid and invalid logon attempts, as well as events related to resource use such as creating, opening, or deleting files or other objects. An administrator can start auditing to record events in the security log.
--> System	                                                                Contains events logged by system components, such as the failure of a driver or other system component to load during startup.
--> CustomLog	                                                              Contains events logged by applications that create a custom log. Using a custom log enables an application to control the size of the log or attach ACLs for security purposes without affecting other applications.


--> Shared Folders is where you will see a complete list of shares and folders shared that others can connect to. 

under Shares, are the default share of Windows, C$, and default remote administration shares created by Windows, such as ADMIN$. 
As with any object in Windows, you can right-click on a folder to view its properties, such as Permissions (who can access the shared resource). 

Under Sessions, you will see a list of users who are currently connected to the shares. In this VM, you won't see anybody connected to the shares.

All the folders and/or files that the connected users access will list under Open Files.


--> In Performance, you'll see a utility called Performance Monitor (perfmon).
Perfmon is used to view performance data either in real-time or from a log file. This utility is useful for troubleshooting performance issues on a computer system, whether local or remote. 


--> Device Manager allows us to view and configure the hardware, such as disabling any hardware attached to the computer.

2.) Storage  

Under Storage is Windows Server Backup and Disk Management. We'll only look at Disk Management in this room.
Note: Since the virtual machine is a Windows Server operating system, there are utilities available that you will typically not see in Windows 10.  

Disk Management is a system utility in Windows that enables you to perform advanced storage tasks.  Some tasks are:
--> Set up a new drive
--> Extend a partition
--> Shrink a partition
--> Assign or change a drive letter (ex. E:) 


3.) Services and Applications

a service is a special type of application that runs in the background. Here you can do more than enable and disable a service, such as view the Properties for the service. 
WMI Control configures and controls the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service.

WMI allows scripting languages (such as VBScript or Windows PowerShell) to manage Microsoft Windows personal computers and servers, both locally and remotely. Microsoft also provides a command-line interface to WMI called Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC).

Note: The WMIC tool is deprecated in Windows 10, version 21H1. Windows PowerShell supersedes this tool for WMI. 


----> System Information (msinfo32) tool
Windows includes a tool called Microsoft System Information (Msinfo32.exe).  This tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive view of your hardware, system components, and software environment, which you can use to diagnose computer issues.

The  information in System Summary is divided into three sections:
--> Hardware Resources
--> Components
--> Software Environment
System Summary will display general technical specifications for the computer, such as processor brand and model.

The information displayed in Hardware Resources is not for the average computer user. If you want to learn more about this section, refer to the official Microsoft page.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/hardware-resources#:~:text=Hardware%20resources%20are%20the%20assignable,of%20bus%2Drelative%20memory%20addresses.

Under Components, you can see specific information about the hardware devices installed on the computer. Some sections don't show any information, but some sections do, such as Display and Input.

In the Software Environment section, you can see information about software baked into the operating system and software you have installed. Other details are visible in this section as well, such as the Environment Variables and Network Connections. 
The environment variables store data that is used by the operating system and other programs. For example, the WINDIR environment variable contains the location of the Windows installation directory. Programs can query the value of this variable to determine where Windows operating system files are located
Click on Environment Variables to see the assigned values for the virtual machine.
Another method to view environment variables is Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables OR Settings > System > About > system info > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables


Let's redirect our attention back to msinfo32 and pick up where we left off.
Towards the very bottom of this utility, there is a search bar. Please give it a go. Select Components and search for IP address.

----> Resource Monitor (resmon)

Resource Monitor displays per-process and aggregate CPU, memory, disk, and network usage information, in addition to providing details about which processes are using individual file handles and modules. Advanced filtering allows users to isolate the data related to one or more processes (either applications or services), start, stop, pause, and resume services, and close unresponsive applications from the user interface. It also includes a process analysis feature that can help identify deadlocked processes and file locking conflicts so that the user can attempt to resolve the conflict instead of closing an application and potentially losing data.

this utility is geared primarily to advanced users who need to perform advanced troubleshooting on the computer system.

In the Overview tab, Resmon has four sections:
--> CPU
--> Disk
--> Network
--> Memory

Note that each tab has additional information for each. An image is shown below for each tab. 

----> command prompt (cmd)
In early operating systems, the command line was the sole way to interact with the operating system.
When the GUI (graphical user interface) was introduced, it allowed users to perform complex tasks with a few clicks of a button instead of entering commands in the command prompt. 

Let's start with a few simple commands, such as hostname and whoami.
The command ""hostname"" will output the computer name. 
The command ""whoami"" will output the name of the logged-in user.

A command used often is ""ipconfig"". This command will show the network address settings for the computer.
A  command to retrieve the help manual for a command is """"""""""""""""/?""""""""""""""""".
For example, to see the help manual for ipconfig, you can use the following command: ipconfig /?

Note: To clear the command prompt screen, the command is cls. 

The next command is netstat. Per the help manual, this command will display protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections. 
netstat \?
The structure tells us the netstat command can be run alone or with parameters, such as -a,  -b,  -e, etc. 
When any of the parameters are appended to the root command, netstat in this case, the output changes.

The net command is primarily used to manage network resources. This command supports sub-commands.
If you type net without a sub-command, the output will show the syntax for the root command showing a few of the sub-commands you can use.

""""""""""" For the net command, to display the help manual /? will not work. In this case, you need to use different syntax, which is net help."""""""""""

So, if you wish to see the help information for net user , the command is net help user. 


Windows Registry
The Windows Registry (per Microsoft) is a central hierarchical database used to store information necessary to configure the system for one or more users, applications, and hardware devices.

The registry contains information that Windows continually references during operation, such as:
--> Profiles for each user
--> Applications installed on the computer and the types of documents that each can create
--> Property sheet settings for folders and application icons
--> What hardware exists on the system
--> The ports that are being used.

Warning: The registry is for advanced computer users. Making changes to the registry can affect normal computer operations. 
There are various ways to view/edit the registry. One way is to use the Registry Editor (regedit).
