Windows Update.

Windows Update is a service provided by Microsoft to provide security updates, feature enhancements, and patches for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Defender.

Updates are typically released on the 2nd Tuesday of each month. This day is called Patch Tuesday. That doesn't necessarily mean that a critical update/patch has to wait for the next Patch Tuesday to be released. If the update is urgent, then Microsoft will push the update via the Windows Update service to the Windows devices.
Windows Update is located in Settings.

"""" Tip: Another way to access Windows Update is from the Run dialog box, or CMD, by running the command control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate."""""

Microsoft notably addressed this issue with Windows 10. The updates can no longer be ignored or pushed to the side until forgotten. Windows updates can only be postponed, but eventually, the update will happen, and your computer will reboot. Microsoft provides these updates to keep the device safe and secure. 

Windows Security

Windows Security is your home to manage the tools that protect your device and your data, Windows Security is also available in Settings. 

focus your attention on Protection areas.
--> Virus & threat protection
--> Firewall & network protection
--> App & browser control
--> Device security

Virus & threat protection

Virus & threat protection is divided into two parts:
--> Current threats
--> Virus & threat protection settings

Current threats

    Scan options:-

--> Quick scan - Checks folders in your system where threats are commonly found.
--> Full scan - Checks all files and running programs on your hard disk. This scan could take longer than one hour.
--> Custom scan - Choose which files and locations you want to check.

    Threat history:-

--> Last scan - Windows Defender Antivirus automatically scans your device for viruses and other threats to help keep it safe.
--> Quarantined threats - Quarantined threats have been isolated and prevented from running on your device. They will be periodically removed.
--> Allowed threats - Allowed threats are items identified as threats, which you allowed to run on your device. 

Warning: Allow an item to run that has been identified as a threat only if you are 100% sure of what you are doing. 

Virus & threat protection settings

    Manage settings:-

--> Real-time protection - Locates and stops malware from installing or running on your device.
--> Cloud-delivered protection - Provides increased and faster protection with access to the latest protection data in the cloud.
--> Automatic sample submission - Send sample files to Microsoft to help protect you and others from potential threats. 
--> Controlled folder access - Protect files, folders, and memory areas on your device from unauthorized changes by unfriendly applications.
--> Exclusions - Windows Defender Antivirus won't scan items that you've excluded.
--> Notifications - Windows Defender Antivirus will send notifications with critical information about the health and security of your device. 

    Virus & threat protection updates:-

--> Check for updates - Manually check for updates to update Windows Defender Antivirus definitions.  

    Ransomware protection:-

Controlled folder access - Ransomware protection requires this feature to be enabled, which in turn requires Real-time protection to be enabled.

Note: Real-time protection is turned off in the attached VM to decrease the chances of performance issues. Since the VM can't reach the Internet and there aren't any threats in the VM, this is safe to do. Real-time protection should definitely be enabled in your

""""""""""" Tip: You can perform on-demand scans on any file/folder by right-clicking the item and selecting 'Scan with Microsoft Defender'.""""""""""""


firewall
Traffic flows into and out of devices via what we call ports. A firewall is what controls what is - and more importantly isn't - allowed to pass through those ports. You can think of it like a security guard standing at the door, checking the ID of everything that tries to enter or exit

Windows Firewall offers three firewall profiles: domain, private and public
--> Domain - The domain profile applies to networks where the host system can authenticate to a domain controller. 
--> Private - The private profile is a user-assigned profile and is used to designate private or home networks.
--> Public - The default profile is the public profile, used to designate public networks such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops, airports, and other locations.

If you click on any firewall profile, another screen will appear with two options: turn the firewall on/off and block all incoming connections. 

Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Defender Firewall\Allowed apps
Allow an app through firewall
You can view what the current settings for any firewall profile are. In the above image, several apps have access in the Private and/or Public firewall profile. Some of the apps will provide additional information if it's available via the Details button. 
Configuring the Windows Defender Firewall is for advanced Windows users.
""""""""""""""""""""""""Tip: Command to open the Windows Defender Firewall is WF.msc."""""""""""""""""""""""""

"""""""""""""""""""""'  Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. under APP & browser Control """""""""""""""""""""""""""""'

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen protects against phishing or malware websites and applications, and the downloading of potentially malicious files

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview

  --> Check apps and files

Windows Defender SmartScreen helps protect your device by checking for unrecognized apps and files from the web. 

 """"""""""""""""""" --> Exploit protection  """""""""""

Exploit protection is built into Windows 10 (and, in our case, Windows Server 2019) to help protect your device against attacks. 


Device Security

--> Core isolation

Memory Integrity - Prevents attacks from inserting malicious code into high-security processes.

The below images are from another machine to show another security feature that should be available in a personal Windows 10 device.
--> Security processor

Trusted Platform Module --> Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. A TPM chip is a secure crypto-processor that is designed to carry out cryptographic operations. The chip includes multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper-resistant, and malicious software is unable to tamper with the security functions of the TPM


BitLocker
BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers

On devices with TPM installed, BitLocker offers the best protection.
BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline

Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)
the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) coordinates the required actions to create a consistent shadow copy (also known as a snapshot or a point-in-time copy) of the data that is to be backed up. 

Volume Shadow Copies are stored on the System Volume Information folder on each drive that has protection enabled.

If VSS is enabled (System Protection turned on), you can perform the following tasks from within advanced system settings. 
--> Create a restore point
--> Perform system restore
--> Configure restore settings
--> Delete restore points

From a security perspective, malware writers know of this Windows feature and write code in their malware to look for these files and delete them. Doing so makes it impossible to recover from a ransomware attack unless you have an offline/off-site backup.
