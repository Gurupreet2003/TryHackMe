Local Area Network (LAN) Topologies

when we refer to the term "topology", we are actually referring to the design or look of the network at hand.

--> Star Topology
The main premise of a star topology is that devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub. This topology is the most commonly found today because of its reliability and scalability - despite the cost.
Any information sent to a device in this topology is sent via the central device to which it connects.

Because more cabling and the purchase of dedicated networking equipment is required for this topology, it is more expensive than any of the other topologies. 
this topology is much more scalable in nature, which means that it is very easy to add more devices as the demand for the network increases.
Unfortunately, the more the network scales, the more maintenance is required to keep the network functional. This increased dependence on maintenance can also make troubleshooting faults much harder.
the star topology is still prone to failure - albeit reduced
if the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, these devices will no longer be able to send or receive data. Thankfully, these centralised hardware devices are often robust.

--> Bus Topology
This type of connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable. This type of topology is similar to the leaf off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable.
Because all data destined for each device travels along the same cable, it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data. This bottleneck also results in very difficult troubleshooting because it quickly becomes difficult to identify which device is experiencing issues with data all travelling along the same route.
bus topologies are one of the easier and more cost-efficient topologies to set up because of their expenses, such as cabling or dedicated networking equipment used to connect these devices.
there is little redundancy in place in case of failures. This disadvantage is because there is a single point of failure along the backbone cable. If this cable were to break, devices can no longer receive or transmit data along the bus.


--> Ring Topology
The ring topology (also known as token topology) boasts some similarities. Devices such as computers are connected directly to each other to form a loop, meaning that there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology.
A ring topology works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the destined device, using other devices along the loop to forward the data. 
device basically forward the data to another device if it not ment for itself but if it want to send a data so it will send data first then forward other device data.
Because there is only one direction for data to travel across this topology, it is fairly easy to troubleshoot any faults that arise. However, this is a double-edged sword because it isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network, as it may have to visit many multiple devices first before reaching the intended device.

ring topologies are less prone to bottlenecks, such as within a bus topology, as large amounts of traffic are not travelling across the network at any one time. The design of this topology does, however, mean that a fault such as cut cable, or broken device will result in the entire networking breaking.



--> What is a Switch?
Switches are dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet. These various devices plug into a switch's port. 
Switches are much more efficient than their lesser counterpart (hubs/repeaters). Switches keep track of what device is connected to which port. This way, when they receive a packet, instead of repeating that packet to every port like a hub would do, it just sends it to the intended target, thus reducing network traffic.
Both Switches and Routers can be connected to one another. The ability to do this increases the redundancy (the reliability) of a network by adding multiple paths for data to take. If one path goes down, another can be used.this may reduce the overall performance of a network because packets have to take longer to travel, there is no downtime

--> What is a Router?
It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them. It does this by using routing
Routing is the label given to the process of data travelling across networks. Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered.
Routing is useful when devices are connected by many paths,



--> Subnetting
Subnetting is the term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself.
Subnetting is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask. 
The same goes for a subnet mask which is also represented as a number of four bytes (32 bits), ranging from 0 to 255 (0-255).

Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:

--> Identify the network address
--> Identify the host address
--> Identify the default gateway

network address --> This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a network's existence.
host address --> An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet
default gateway --> The default gateway address is a special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network Any data that needs to go to a device that isn't on the same network will be sent to this device. These devices can use any host address but usually use either the first or last host address in a network(.1 or .254)

Subnetting provides a range of benefits, including:

--> Efficiency
--> Security
--> Full control
 Let's take the typical cafÃ© on the street. This cafe will have two networks:

--> One for employees, cash registers, and other devices for the facility
--> One for the general public to use as a hotspot
Subnetting allows you to separate these two use cases from each other whilst having the benefits of a connection to larger networks such as the Internet.

---->  ARP PROTOCOL

the Address Resolution Protocol or ARP for short, is the technology that is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network.
the ARP protocol allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network. Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices.

When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device. Devices can use the ARP protocol to find the MAC address (and therefore the physical identifier) of a device for communication.

How does ARP Work?

Each device within a network has a ledger to store information on, which is called a cache. In the context of the ARP protocol, this cache stores the identifiers of other devices on the network.

In order to map these two identifiers together (IP address and MAC address), the ARP protocol sends two types of messages:

--> ARP Request
--> ARP Reply

When an ARP request is sent, a message is broadcasted on the network to other devices asking, "What is the mac address that owns this IP address?" When the other devices receive that message, they will only respond if they own that IP address and will send an ARP reply with its MAC address. The requesting device can now remember this mapping and store it in its ARP cache for future use.

FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF --> broadcast mac address


------> DHCP PROTOCOL

IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network. The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer). The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request), and then lastly, the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).

--> DHCP Discover -- device sends out a request for ip 
--> DHCP offer -- server give the ip to device
--> DHCP request -- device accept the ip and ask server to accept it to
--> DHCP ACK (acknowldegment) -- server accept the ip (after this the device start using the assign ip)
