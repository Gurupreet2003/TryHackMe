  -->  What is Burp Suite
Burp Suite is web application security testing framework. 
Burp Suite is a Java-based framework.
It has become the industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications, including those that rely on application programming interfaces (APIs).
Simply put, Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server. This fundamental capability forms the backbone of the framework. By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various components within the Burp Suite framework. The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before they are received by our browser makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.

--> Burp Suite Professional is an unrestricted version of Burp Suite Community. It comes with features such as:
1.)  An automated vulnerability scanner.
2.)  A fuzzer/brute-forcer that isn't rate limited.
3.)  Saving projects for future use and report generation.
4.)  A built-in API to allow integration with other tools.
5.)  Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality.
6.)  Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger-owned server).

--> Burp Suite Enterprise, in contrast to the community and professional editions, is primarily utilized for continuous scanning. It features an automated scanner that periodically scans web applications for vulnerabilities, similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning. Unlike the other editions, which allow manual attacks from a local machine, Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.

  -->  Features of Burp Community
 it provides an impressive array of tools that are highly valuable for web application testing. 

1.)  Proxy: The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.

2.)  Repeater: Another well-known feature. Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
Repeater is used for manually crafting and sending individual HTTP requests to a web server and analyzing the responses. It is ideal for manual testing and debugging.

3.)  Intruder: Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, Intruder allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
Intruder is designed for automated, high-volume attacks on web applications. It is used for discovering vulnerabilities by sending a large number of requests with varying inputs.

4.)  Decoder: Decoder offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient. 
The Decoder tool is used for transforming and analyzing encoded or obfuscated data. It helps in decoding data formats like Base64, URL encoding, and others to understand and manipulate them.

5.)  Comparer: As the name suggests, Comparer enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
The Comparer tool is used for comparing two pieces of data to identify differences and similarities. This is particularly useful for analyzing changes in responses or requests.

6.)  Sequencer: Sequencer is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks. 
The Sequencer tool is used to analyze the randomness and quality of session tokens and other values that are supposed to be unpredictable. It assesses how well the values generated by the application resist predictability.

Beyond the built-in features, the Java codebase of Burp Suite facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework's functionality. These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter). The Burp Suite Extender module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the BApp Store, enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration, there are still a considerable number of extensions available for Burp Community. For instance, the Logger++ module can extend the built-in logging functionality of Burp Suite.

  -->  The Dashboard
configuration for Burp Suite (window after running burp suite) It is generally recommended to keep the default settings, which are suitable for most situations.

The Burp Dashboard is divided into four quadrants, as labelled in counter-clockwise order starting from the top left:

1.)  Tasks: The Tasks menu allows you to define background tasks that Burp Suite will perform while you use the application. In Burp Suite Community, the default “Live Passive Crawl” task, which automatically logs the pages visited, is sufficient for our purposes in this module. Burp Suite Professional offers additional features like on-demand scans.

2.)  Event log: The Event log provides information about the actions performed by Burp Suite, such as starting the proxy, as well as details about connections made through Burp.

3.)  Issue Activity: This section is specific to Burp Suite Professional. It displays the vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanner, ranked by severity and filterable based on the certainty of the vulnerability.

4.)  Advisory: The Advisory section provides more detailed information about the identified vulnerabilities, including references and suggested remediations. This information can be exported into a report. In Burp Suite Community, this section may not show any vulnerabilities.

Throughout the various tabs and windows of Burp Suite, you will notice question mark icons. Clicking on these icons opens a new window with helpful information specific to that section.

  -->  Navigation
-->  Module Selection: The top row of the menu bar displays the available modules in Burp Suite. You can click on each module to switch between them. For example, the Burp Proxy module is selected in the image below.

-->  Sub-Tabs: If a selected module has multiple sub-tabs, they can be accessed through the second menu bar that appears directly below the main menu bar. These sub-tabs often contain module-specific settings and options. For example, in the image above, the Proxy Intercept sub-tab is selected within the Burp Proxy module.

-->  Detaching Tabs: If you prefer to view multiple tabs separately, you can detach them into separate windows. To do this, go to the Window option in the application menu above the Module Selection bar. From there, choose the "Detach" option, and the selected tab will open in a separate window. The detached tabs can be reattached using the same method.

  -->  Options
here are two types of settings: Global settings (also known as User settings) and Project settings.
-->  Global Settings: These settings affect the entire Burp Suite installation and are applied every time you start the application. They provide a baseline configuration for your Burp Suite environment.
-->  Project Settings: These settings are specific to the current project and apply only during the session. However, please note that Burp Suite Community Edition does not support saving projects, so any project-specific options will be lost when you close Burp.

To access the settings, click on the Settings button in the top navigation bar. This will open a separate settings window.

In the Settings window, you will find a menu on the left-hand side. This menu allows you to switch between different types of settings, including:
step 1.)  Search: Enables searching for specific settings using keywords.
step 2.)  Type filter: Filters the settings for User and Project options.
-->  User settings: Shows settings that affect the entire Burp Suite installation.
-->  Project settings: Displays settings specific to the current project.
step 3.)  Categories: Allows selecting settings by category.

It's worth noting that many tools within Burp Suite provide shortcuts to specific categories of settings. For example, the Proxy module includes a Proxy settings button that opens the settings window directly to the relevant proxy section.

  -->  Introduction to the Burp Proxy
The Burp Proxy is a fundamental and crucial tool within Burp Suite. It enables the capture of requests and responses between the user and the target web server. This intercepted traffic can be manipulated, sent to other tools for further processing, or explicitly allowed to continue to its destination.

-->  Key Points to Understand About the Burp Proxy

*  Intercepting Requests: When requests are made through the Burp Proxy, they are intercepted and held back from reaching the target server. The requests appear in the Proxy tab, allowing for further actions such as forwarding, dropping, editing, or sending them to other Burp modules. To disable the intercept and allow requests to pass through the proxy without interruption, click the Intercept is on button.

*  Taking Control: The ability to intercept requests empowers testers to gain complete control over web traffic, making it invaluable for testing web applications.

*  Capture and Logging: Burp Suite captures and logs requests made through the proxy by default, even when the interception is turned off. This logging functionality can be helpful for later analysis and review of prior requests.

*  WebSocket Support: Burp Suite also captures and logs WebSocket communication, providing additional assistance when analysing web applications.

*  Logs and History: The captured requests can be viewed in the HTTP history and WebSockets history sub-tabs, allowing for retrospective analysis and sending the requests to other Burp modules as needed.

Proxy-specific options can be accessed by clicking the Proxy settings button. These options provide extensive control over the Proxy’s behaviour and functionality.

--> Some Notable Features in the Proxy Settings
*  Response Interception: By default, the proxy does not intercept server responses unless explicitly requested on a per-request basis. The "Intercept responses based on the following rules" checkbox, along with the defined rules, allows for a more flexible response interception.

*  Match and Replace: The "Match and Replace" section in the Proxy settings enables the use of regular expressions (regex) to modify incoming and outgoing requests. This feature allows for dynamic changes, such as modifying the user agent or manipulating cookies.

  -->  Connecting through the Proxy (FoxyProxy)
To use the Burp Suite Proxy, we need to configure our local web browser to redirect traffic through Burp Suite. we will focus on configuring the proxy using the FoxyProxy extension in Firefox.

i already know how to configure forxy proxy

-->  Remember the following:
*  When the proxy configuration is active, and the intercept is switched on in Burp Suite, your browser will hang whenever you make a request.
*  Be cautious not to leave the intercept switched on unintentionally, as it can prevent your browser from making any requests.
*  Right-clicking on a request in Burp Suite allows you to perform various actions, such as forwarding, dropping, sending to other tools, or selecting options from the right-click menu.

  -->  Site Map and Issue Definitions
The Target tab in Burp Suite provides more than just control over the scope of our testing. It consists of three sub-tabs:

1.)  Site map: This sub-tab allows us to map out the web applications we are targeting in a tree structure. Every page that we visit while the proxy is active will be displayed on the site map. This feature enables us to automatically generate a site map by simply browsing the web application. In Burp Suite Professional, we can also use the site map to perform automated crawling of the target, exploring links between pages and mapping out as much of the site as possible. Even with Burp Suite Community, we can still utilize the site map to accumulate data during our initial enumeration steps. It is particularly useful for mapping out APIs, as any API endpoints accessed by the web application will be captured in the site map.

2.)  Issue definitions: Although Burp Community does not include the full vulnerability scanning functionality available in Burp Suite Professional, we still have access to a list of all the vulnerabilities that the scanner looks for. The Issue definitions section provides an extensive list of web vulnerabilities, complete with descriptions and references. This resource can be valuable for referencing vulnerabilities in reports or assisting in describing a particular vulnerability that may have been identified during manual testing.

3.)  Scope settings: This setting allows us to control the target scope in Burp Suite. It enables us to include or exclude specific domains/IPs to define the scope of our testing. By managing the scope, we can focus on the web applications we are specifically targeting and avoid capturing unnecessary traffic.

Overall, the Target tab offers features beyond scoping, allowing us to map out web applications, fine-tune our target scope, and access a comprehensive list of web vulnerabilities for reference purposes.

  -->  The Burp Suite Browser
To start the Burp Browser, click the Open Browser button in the proxy tab. A Chromium window will pop up, and any requests made in this browser will go through the proxy.

Note: There are many settings related to the Burp Browser in the project options and user options settings. Make sure to explore and customise them as needed.

However, if you are running Burp Suite on Linux as the root user (as is the case with the AttackBox), you may encounter an error preventing the Burp Browser from starting due to the inability to create a sandbox environment.

There are two simple solutions to this:

1.)  Smart option: Create a new user and run Burp Suite under a low-privilege account to allow the Burp Browser to run without issues.
2.)  Easy option: Go to Settings -> Tools -> Burp's browser and check the Allow Burp's browser to run without a sandbox option. Enabling this option will allow the browser to start without a sandbox. However, please be aware that this option is disabled by default for security reasons. If you choose to enable it, exercise caution, as compromising the browser could grant an attacker access to your entire machine. In the training environment of the AttackBox, this is unlikely to be a significant issue, but use it responsibly.

  -->  Scoping and Targeting
Capturing and logging all of the traffic can quickly become overwhelming and inconvenient, especially when we only want to focus on specific web applications. This is where scoping comes in.

"""  By setting a scope for the project, we can define what gets proxied and logged in Burp Suite. We can restrict Burp Suite to target only the specific web application(s) we want to test. The easiest way to do this is by switching to the Target tab, right-clicking on our target from the list on the left, and selecting Add To Scope. Burp will then prompt us to choose whether we want to stop logging anything that is not in scope, and in most cases, we want to select yes.  """

To check our scope, we can switch to the Scope settings sub-tab within the Target tab.

The Scope settings window allows us to control our target scope by including or excluding domains/IPs. This section is powerful and worth spending time getting familiar with.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  However, even if we disabled logging for out-of-scope traffic, the proxy will still intercept everything. To prevent this, we need to go to the Proxy settings sub-tab and select And URL Is in target scope from the "Intercept Client Requests" section.  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Enabling this option ensures that the proxy completely ignores any traffic that is not within the defined scope, resulting in a cleaner traffic view in Burp Suite.

""""""""""""""""""""""  -->  Proxying HTTPS  """""""""""""""""""""""""

When intercepting HTTP traffic, we may encounter an issue when navigating to sites with TLS enabled. For example, when accessing a site like https://google.com/, we may receive an error indicating that the PortSwigger Certificate Authority (CA) is not authorised to secure the connection. This happens because the browser does not trust the certificate presented by Burp Suite.

To overcome this issue, we can manually add the PortSwigger CA certificate to our browser's list of trusted certificate authorities. Here's how to do it:

step 1.) Download the CA Certificate: With the Burp Proxy activated, navigate to http://burp/cert. This will download a file called cacert.der. Save this file somewhere on your machine.
step 2.) Access Firefox Certificate Settings: Type about:preferences into your Firefox URL bar and press Enter. This will take you to the Firefox settings page. Search the page for "certificates" and click on the View Certificates button.
step 3.) Import the CA Certificate: In the Certificate Manager window, click on the Import button. Select the cacert.der file that you downloaded in the previous step.
step 4.) Set Trust for the CA Certificate: In the subsequent window that appears, check the box that says "Trust this CA to identify websites" and click OK.

  -->  Example Attack
We will start by taking a look at the support form at http://10.10.203.207/ticket/

--> In a real-world web app pentest, we would test this for a variety of things, one of which would be Cross-Site Scripting (or XSS). If you have not yet encountered XSS, it can be thought of as injecting a client-side script (usually in Javascript) into a webpage in such a way that it executes. There are various kinds of XSS – the type that we are using here is referred to as "Reflected" XSS, as it only affects the person making the web request.

--> Walkthrough
Try typing: <script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</script>, into the "Contact Email" field. You should find that there is a client-side filter in place which prevents you from adding any special characters that aren't allowed in email addresses:
Fortunately for us, client-side filters are absurdly easy to bypass. There are a variety of ways we could disable the script or just prevent it from loading in the first place.
Let's focus on simply bypassing the filter for now.
First, make sure that your Burp Proxy is active and that intercept is on.
Now, enter some legitimate data into the support form. For example: "pentester@example.thm" as an email address, and "Test Attack" as a query.
Submit the form — the request should be intercepted by the proxy.
With the request captured in the proxy, we can now change the email field to be our very simple payload from above: <script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</script>. After pasting in the payload, we need to select it, then URL encode it with the Ctrl + U shortcut to make it safe to send. This process is shown in the GIF below:


The more you use Burp Suite, the more proficient you will become in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.
